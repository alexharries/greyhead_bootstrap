This folder contains template file overrides for the Greyhead
Bootstrap theme.

The easiest way to get started with editing one of these templates is to copy
the entire /templates directory into your subtheme directory, because this will
also provide the contents of /partials, which you need - and then remove any
un-needed template files from /templates, without removing the contents of
/templates/partials unless/until you're 100% sure you don't need them.
